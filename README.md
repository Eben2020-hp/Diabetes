In order to truly understand what Machine Learning is all of us need to perform analysis in different domains. This is the doamin assigned to me for the second semester of my Masters program in Data Science in Christ University. 

## Data Collection
This data 

## Project Conclusion
In this particular analysis what I have found is that the model only yields me a 60% accuracy. It is not great but being a fresher this was the way I approached it.

- **Further Scope of the study**

One can work in reducing the number of features used and also increase thew accuracy of the model.

## Resources
I have seeked the help of certain articles and codes inorder to complete this work. The links of all relevant informtion is provided.
